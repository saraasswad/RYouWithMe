# Headings
You can make levels of headings in R markdown documents using hashes.

# One hash for big headings
## Two hashes for smaller headings
### Three hashes for evensmaller headings
#### and so on..

# Bolds and Italics
You can make things bold or italics using  asterisks on both sides of the text. Use two asterisks for bold and one for italics.

**I want this bold**

*I want this italics*
 
 \* to show an asterisks.
 
# Bullet points
You can make bullet points with dashes.

- bullet 1
- bullet 2
- bullet 3

Do not forget to put a space after the dash to get a bullet point.

# Quotes
Get quotes using a >

> "Happiness is a decision -  Sarah Alasswad, Biomedical scientist"

# Links
Put the words that you want to use as the link in square brackets, and the url that you want to link to in round brackets.

You can find all the code to this course on [My github account](https://github.com/saraasswad/RYouWithMe).

# Pictures/tweets/gifs
It is pretty easy to embed all kinds of media into Rmarkdown documents.

### Picture
Use `![](nameofimage.png)`

![](drinkingcoffee.JPG)

### Tweets
Use the embed code from Twitter to insert a tweet.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I think I might come back just for your sake Lily üòç<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Duolingo?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Duolingo</a> <a href="https://t.co/k6Yc6zRJLf">pic.twitter.com/k6Yc6zRJLf</a></p>&mdash; Sarah (@saraasswad) <a href="https://twitter.com/saraasswad/status/1413507123695165440?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 9, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>


### Gifs
Use the link from giphy and write it into `<img src="link from giphy">`.


Another way is to insert is as an image but write the link to the gif insted of the name between the parenthesis.



Also insert HTML symboles like theta: $\Theta$ 

$$
\beta = 2.5\cdot  \alpha
$$

# What about Code?
R markdown is nice because you can incorporate your code and get the output you want in a tidy fashion.

Mac: alt-command-I Windows: alt-control-I

Remember, you can suppress messages and warnings in the header of the chunks.

```{r include=FALSE}
source(here::here("scripts", "basics.R"))
```


# Load packages

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)

# I can set the options globally with the following code
# This way I don't have to do it with every chunk
# But I can override it if I want
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE,
message = FALSE,
warning = FALSE)

library(here)
library(janitor)
library(tinytex)
```

# Read data
```{r}
cleanbeaches_new <- readr::read_csv(here("data", "cleanbeaches_new.csv"))
  
```

# Plot mean buglevels by site

We can create neat data summaries and clean them up using knitr
```{r}
cleanbeaches_new %>%
  group_by(site) %>%
  summarise(meanbugs = mean(beachbugs,na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  knitr::kable()
```
# Or we can plot the results

```{r}
cleanbeaches_new %>%
  group_by(site)%>%
  summarise(meanbugs = mean(beachbugs,na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = site, y = meanbugs))+
  geom_col()+
  coord_flip()+
  theme_classic()
```

# Output
We can knit to different formats: pdf, html, word...
If we delete the default from the yaml (or the header) and write under it toc: TRUE we will have a table of content.
pdf need tinytex package to be installed, next we need to set the pdf_document in the header to latex_engine: xelatex, finally we need to delete the url to any gifs included.(simply follow error message that appear in the console). P.s. proud of myself to having solved that :). 

The header of the document will need to be modified in order to change output styles. Though RStudio will
allow you to use the knit button to select the output style.

```{r}
download.file(url = "https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/images/format-dropdown.png",
destfile = "dropdown.png",
mode = 'wb')
knitr::include_graphics(path = "dropdown.png")
##include graphics is to insert image
```
